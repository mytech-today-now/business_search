## Purpose & Description

This web application exists to solve a critical business development challenge: **quickly and efficiently identifying potential clients within a specific geographic area**. By leveraging OpenStreetMap's comprehensive business database through the Overpass API, users can generate targeted mailing lists without the cost and complexity of traditional business directory services or Google API dependencies.

**What this webpage does for users:**

- **Define a geographic search radius** (in miles) around a central U.S. ZIP code.
- **Select from a set of predefined business categories** (e.g., "lawyers," "florists," "hospitals," etc.).
- **Add custom categories** (key:value pairs) when needed.
- **Fetch business data from OpenStreetMap's Overpass API** (no API key required).
- **Parse results into CSV files** containing fields such as name, address, phone, email, and website.
- **Download individual CSVs** or bundle all CSVs into a single ZIP file via the JSZip library.
- Quickly assemble mailing lists of potential clients for direct marketing, outreach, or data analysis purposes.
